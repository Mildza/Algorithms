# Algorithms

## Part 1

1. Function that returns the sum of all numbers.
2. To given rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisk(\*).
3. For given integer, return the sum of its digits.
4. For given array of integers, find the pair of adjacent element that has the largest product.
5. For a given array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.
6. Given a sequence of array of integers, determine if it is possible to obtain strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.
7. Given string, replace each character by the next one (English alphabet, z would be replaced by a).
8. Check whether the given string is a subsequence of the plaintext alphabet.
9. For a given array of positive integers, return array of two integers, sum of even and odd values.
10. Two array are called similiar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

## Part 2

1. For a given array of integers, on each move it's allowed to increase exactly one of it's element by one. Find the minimal moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

2. After algorithm has finished, there will be a single element left in the array.
   On the 1st, 3rd, 5th ... iterations replace each pair of consecutive elements with their sum.
   On the 2nd, 4th, 6th ... iterations replace each pair of consecutive elements with their product.
